            <p>In this project from UX 1400 I, along with a team of two other people, designed the user experience of a game that could benefit MSOE students. The game that we designed was an online scavenger hunt to familiarize students with my.msoe.edu, the main website where we can get our student information. As one of the designers, I took a large part in creating the user flow and journey, as well as the prototype. As we only had 2 weeks to complete this we had frequent meetings to allow for a thorough design process. The final deliverable was a design brief, which included interviews with students, the user flow and journey, as well as the prototype.</p>
            <p>This was my first time really prioritizing user experience in a project, which turned out to be very successful. In other projects I had always tried to make the user experience as intuitive as possible, but I hadn’t spent as much time as I should’ve, and I didn’t know the principles that I learned throughout this project. The main constraint of this project was time. As we only had 2 weeks, we didn’t have time to develop the project, only the user experience. It is unfortunate that we didn’t have enough time to develop our idea, however only having to worry about the user experience allowed us to learn a lot about user experience which can be applied easily to other projects. In this project I familiarized myself with mural, a tool that we used to create the prototype. I also learned about the importance of the user flow and journey, as before this project I had never written an application from the user’s perspective, I had only written applications that made sense to me which might not be intuitive to the user as I fully understood how the program worked and where everything was in the application. This project taught me to write programs from the user’s perspective, and the importance of spending the time to create a user flow and a prototype.</p>
