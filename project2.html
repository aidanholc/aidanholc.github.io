      <p>In this group project from my high school capstone, we developed a web application that stored all the music and that allowed for easy additions and changes to the database. We did this by working closely with the customer, the band directors, to ensure that we developed every feature they desired and didn’t add more than they needed. As this was a large project, my role changed throughout the year. At the start of the project all of the data was not yet online and had no standardization for the parameters of each piece. As I was the one who knew the most about the music, it was my job to develop a set of parameters that can accurately describe each piece. Once that was developed I had to go through each piece of music, of which there was roughly a thousand, and get all of the information into an excel sheet to then later export into a SQL database. Completing this took roughly ¾ of the year, and other teammates were creating the website as this was being done. After I finished this I spent the rest of the year helping on finishing various tasks on the website as well as setting up all the CSS of the website.</p>
      <p>I was very happy with how the final deliverable turned out. As we got later into the year it was looking like we were behind schedule, but development wasn’t linear as we had to learn everything before we could develop anything. The main constraints of this project were time and money. Although we finished the website and it completely works, there are still some features that we had to leave out and the security for the website is buggy and makes accessing the website harder than it should be. This could have been solved with more time or money, as we had to opt into using products that were free or very cheap if there was no free alternative, which made certain tasks harder than they needed to be. With more time we could’ve learned how to fix some of our issues and made the user experience smoother. Before this project I had rarely used JavaScript and I had never used SQL and I learned a lot about both of these languages. The main oversight we had in this project was not spending enough time in the design phase. We had rushed through the design phase so we could start working, but this lead to lots of issues and complications that took up more time than a thorough design phase would’ve.</p>
