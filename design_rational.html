            <h1>Design Rational</h1>
            <h2>C.R.A.P. Design</h2>
            <p>The first design principle I focused on was CRAP design. I coded my website, but I used a template so I didn’t have to do everything from scratch. CRAP design is what I used as the criteria for finding a good template. My website has good contrast, as it is mainly a white background with black text. I also ensured that the pictures that can be clicked to go to my projects darken when you hover over them to make the text easier to read. My website also has lots of repetition, as all the project pages have the same format and the menu bar is always in the same place. The alignment of my website wasn’t overly complex, most things are left aligned unless I am trying to introduce a new section, then the header is center aligned. Proximity was the main driver of how the pages got separated. I know some students had put all projects on one page, but I believe that it is better to separate them, so the reader is only looking at one idea at a time. This will help them be less confused and overwhelmed while reading about my projects.</p>
            <h2>User Journey</h2>
            <p>Due to time constraints I didn’t construct a user journey, but it was something I was considering through every step of creating my portfolio. My projects are the most impressive part of my portfolio, which is why I chose to make them so apparent on the home page. I first wanted the user to read my about me, but then I wanted them to look at my projects before anything else. This led me to make those the only things apparent on the home page, so for all the other information the user would have to use the menu bar. I placed the menu bar in the most appropriate spot on the site, the top right corner, but I recognized that this could be a potential pain point if they don’t see it right away, which is why in my call to action I mentioned where the menu bar is.</p>
            <h2>UX in Data Science</h2>
            <p>My career goal is to become a data scientist. The responsibility of a data scientist is to essentially use data to either make predictions or find patterns in data, and then present the information they find to solve business problems. This means that presenting the data and displaying it in a user-friendly way is a very large part of the job. You can be the most analytical person in the world and be an expert on using the machine learning parts of data science, but if you can’t present your findings well you aren’t going to find success in your career. It is then easy to see how important user experience will be for me in the future, as I’ll have to be able to present my findings in a way that it is easy for anyone to understand and draw conclusions from. </p>
